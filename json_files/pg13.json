and Pacific Islander Family Resources Network (APIFRN)","long_description":"Asian and Pacific Islander Family Resources Network (APIFRN) is a collaboration of 20+ agencies providing family support services to Asian and Pacific Islander (API) families in the City and County of San Francisco. A project of APA Family Support Services (formerly Asian Perinatal Advocates), APIFRN offers comprehensive care and support services for API families with children, ages 0-18 years old.\n\nThe mutual goals of the project are: strengthen API families and reduce the likelihood of out-of-home placements, increase the use of neighborhood-based resources, and assist families in accessing services in San Francisco.\n\nThe APIFRN emphasizes a proactive approach towards the prevention of problems: partner agencies help the family function more effectively and foster a sense of family self-sufficiency and empowerment. The network partners utilize a “building on strengths family model” to promote growth, empowerment and resiliency. Program services are driven by participants’ needs and are responsive in addressing these needs. Network parents play an important role in the design and development of program services and activities, serve as resources for each other, and advocate for themselves in the broader community.

The network partners utilize a “building on strengths family model” to promote growth, empowerment and resiliency. Program services are driven by participants’ needs and are responsive in addressing these needs. Network parents play an important role in the design and development of program services and activities, serve as resources for each other, and advocate for themselves in the broader community.
