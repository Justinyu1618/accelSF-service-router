Program youth meet after school four days a week from 2-5 pm or 3-5 pm for homework assistance and peer tutoring. Leadership workshops are offered twice-weekly and English language clinics are offered once a month. Youth also help plan and participate in volunteer events 3-4 times a semester.

Educational Program for 5-12th Grade Youth","long_description":"**They support San Francisco students on the path to college.**\n\nBreakthrough provides intensive academic enrichment and support to motivated San Francisco students with limited educational opportunities. Students apply to Breakthrough as fourth graders at public elementary schools in San Francisco. They seek students who want to attend college but are historically underrepresented there. \n\nSummer Program for Rising 5-8th Graders: For four years, during the summers prior to 5-8th grade, students attend an intensive six-week summer program. Each day, they take four hours of challenging classes in math, science, literature, and writing, and complete one to two hours of homework nightly. They also work on study skills, attend elective classes, participate in engaging leadership development opportunities like outdoor education and Career Day, and join a supportive community of learners. \n\nAfter-School Support for 5-8th Graders: During their 5-8th grade school years, students attend an after-school program twice weekly, receiving personalized tutoring and taking enrichment classes. They also assist all students with the middle and high school admissions processes.\n\nAfter-School Support for 9-12th Graders: During their 9-12th grade years, students attend monthly Saturday workshops on the college application process, career exploration, diversity and inclusion, and effective decision making, among other topics.
