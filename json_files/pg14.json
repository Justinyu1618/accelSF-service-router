This Clubhouse is located just one-quarter mile from our Mission Clubhouse — also in the Mission District.\n\nFor many decades, Columbia Park Clubhouse was the sole Clubhouse of the Columbia Park Boys & Girls Club organization. In 2001, the Columbia Park Boys & Girls Club merged with the San Francisco Boys & Girls Club to become Boys & Girls Clubs of San Francisco. This Clubhouse serves youth from across the city, but primarily those from western side of the Mission.\n\nThis clubhouse is located at 450 Guerrero Street San Francisco, CA 94110.

A new Clubhouse was built in 1955 and a full-scale renovation was completed in 1998. Columbia Park Clubhouse is the largest Clubhouse at approximately 32,000 square feet. This Clubhouse is located just one-quarter mile from our Mission Clubhouse — also in the Mission District.\n\nFor many decades, Columbia Park Clubhouse was the sole Clubhouse of the Columbia Park Boys & Girls Club organization. In 2001, the Columbia Park Boys & Girls Club merged with the San Francisco Boys & Girls Club to become Boys & Girls Clubs of San Francisco.
