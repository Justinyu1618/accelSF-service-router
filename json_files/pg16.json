provide trans and nonbinary people with low-barrier funds and support to correct names and/or gender markers on identifying legal documents, fund gender-affirming permanent hair removal, and supply necessities for our trans siblings behind bars.\n\nPutting money directly into trans people’s hands is central to economic and racial justice and our overall well-being. Redistributing funds draws inspiration from the principles of mutual aid: our support of each other is a political act.\n\nMicrogrants that may be available: (Please check website for open grants)\n\n- **Name Change Microgrants**- cover all the required fees pertaining to court-ordered name changes. They cover corrections and updates on passports, driver’s licenses, state IDs, birth certificates, and Tribal IDs.\n\n- **Inside Advocacy: Commissary and Post-Release Microgrants** - provides mutual aid to trans folks who are incarcerated or have been recently released. Trans folks impacted by the carceral state are the most vulnerable and cut off from resources. So far, IA has served nearly 400 people. We continue to use our unique place in the TLGBQ+ and suicide prevention movements to partner with other organizations, fight injustice, and advocate for our community.\n\n- **Gender-Affirming Hair Removal Microgrants** - This microgrant seeks to cover a wide spectrum of permanent hair removal procedures for people who experience transmisogyny: the specific oppression directed towards people perceived as transfeminine. This includes trans women, trans femmes, Two Spirit people, and trans and gender non-conforming people who were assigned/assumed male at birth—but is not limited to these labels!\n\nAll Grant programs

provide trans and nonbinary people with low-barrier funds and support to correct names and/or gender markers on identifying legal documents, fund gender-affirming permanent hair removal, and supply necessities for our trans siblings behind bars.\n\nPutting money directly into trans people’s hands is central to economic and racial justice and our overall well-being. Redistributing funds draws inspiration from the principles of mutual aid: our support of each other is a political act.\n\nMicrogrants that may be available: (Please check website for open grants)\n\n- **Name Change Microgrants**- cover all the required fees pertaining to court-ordered name changes. They cover corrections and updates on passports, driver’s licenses, state IDs, birth certificates, and Tribal IDs.\n\n- **Inside Advocacy: Commissary and Post-Release Microgrants** - provides mutual aid to trans folks who are incarcerated or have been recently released. Trans folks impacted by the carceral state are the most vulnerable and cut off from resources. So far, IA has served nearly 400 people. We continue to use our unique place in the TLGBQ+ and suicide prevention movements to partner with other organizations, fight injustice, and advocate for our community.\n\n- **Gender-Affirming Hair Removal Microgrants** - This microgrant seeks to cover a wide spectrum of permanent hair removal procedures for people who experience transmisogyny: the specific oppression directed towards people perceived as transfeminine. This includes trans women, trans femmes, Two Spirit people, and trans and gender non-conforming people who were assigned/assumed male at birth—but is not limited to these labels!\n\nAll Grant programs
