The majority of clients are seeking asylum and come from the Northern Triangle in Central America and Mexico.  Most of the children the clinic represents are also eligible for Special Immigrant Juvenile status and the clinic represents these children in state court as well.\n\nUnder the supervision of the director and supervising attorney, students work closely with clients in preparation for their asylum hearings or interviews at the Asylum Office, including the drafting of declarations and supporting evidence, as well as the preparation of direct testimony and practice for their hearing or interview. Some students also help minors in state probate and family law courts who seek guardianships or custody findings in order to qualify for Special Immigrant Juvenile Status. Through their work, students learn how to be ethical and successful immigration attorneys in a nonprofit setting.\n\nThe clinic has over 500 active cases. It also employs two other attorneys, three paralegals, and a social services coordinator. The clinic works with people who have escaped extreme violence and trauma, and clients' bravery and strength inspire clinic employees and students alike. In addition to casework, students have the opportunity to participate in clinic-organized events, such as Know Your Rights presentations in the Central Valley and trips to immigration detention facilities and the border.\nThe clinic partners with collaboratives in San Francisco, Sonoma, and San Mateo counties, and is funded by the City and County of San Francisco, San Mateo County, the Secure Families Collaborative in Sonoma County, and the California Department of Social Services. The clinic also works closely with the Bar Association of San Francisco and community-based organizations throughout California.\n\n\n\n\n","eligibility":null,"required_documents":null,"fee":null,"application_process":"For more information contact the Immigration and Deportation Defense Clinic via email at lawcommunications@usfca.edu.

The majority of clients are seeking asylum and come from the Northern Triangle in Central America and Mexico.  Most of the children the clinic represents are also eligible for Special Immigrant Juvenile status and the clinic represents these children in state court as well.\n\nUnder the supervision of the director and supervising attorney, students work closely with clients in preparation for their asylum hearings or interviews at the Asylum Office, including the drafting of declarations and supporting evidence, as well as the preparation of direct testimony and practice for their hearing or interview. Some students also help minors in state probate and family law courts who seek guardianships or custody findings in order to qualify for Special Immigrant Juvenile Status. Through their work, students learn how to be ethical and successful immigration attorneys in a nonprofit setting.\n\nThe clinic has over 500 active cases. It also employs two other attorneys, three paralegals, and a social services coordinator. The clinic works with people who have escaped extreme violence and trauma, and clients' bravery and strength inspire clinic employees and students alike. In addition to casework, students have the opportunity to participate in clinic-organized events, such as Know Your Rights presentations in the Central Valley and trips to immigration detention facilities and the border.\nThe clinic partners with collaboratives in San Francisco, Sonoma, and San Mateo counties, and is funded by the City and County of San Francisco, San Mateo County, the Secure Families Collaborative in Sonoma County, and the California Department of Social Services.
