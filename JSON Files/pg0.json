Welfare Fraud","long_description":"California Department of Social Services accepts reports of Welfare fraud. \nTo report fraud, find the state in which the suspect of committed crime lives. \n\n**KEEP in mind the following when reporting fraud:**\n- Anonymously reporting suspected fraud may or may not be permitted by the appropriate officials. If caller wishes to remain anonymous, ask about the policy on anonymous reports before providing any information.\n- Be aware that fraud is normally a criminal offense. Once reported, it is most likely that caller will not be contacted again or 'updated on the progress' of any criminal investigation. It is strictly prohibited in criminal investigations.\n- Have as much information as possible when making the report. The more information available to officials, the more likely investigations will be initiated.\n- Unfounded reports filed for retribution or spite can result in the individual vulnerable to criminal charges.\n\n**For more information or benefits support visit [BenefitsCal](https://benefitscal.com/).**  ","eligibility":null,"required_documents":null,"fee":null,"application_process":"For reporting

If caller wishes to remain anonymous, ask about the policy on anonymous reports before providing any information.\n- Be aware that fraud is normally a criminal offense. Once reported, it is most likely that caller will not be contacted again or 'updated on the progress' of any criminal investigation. It is strictly prohibited in criminal investigations.\n- Have as much information as possible when making the report. The more information available to officials, the more likely investigations will be initiated.\n- Unfounded reports filed for retribution or spite can result in the individual vulnerable to criminal
