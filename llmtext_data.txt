The service name is LAWYER REFERRAL & INFORMATION SERVICES.
Here is a description of the service it offers:

CLA is a State Bar of California Certified  Lawyer Referral and Information Service (LRIS) and can match you with a qualified attorney.

 
The following are the required documents to receive the service:
See Application Process above
The fee is Depends upon eligibility sliding scale.
Here is the information for the application process:
STEP 1: Intake

If your adjusted gross income on your IRS 1040 Income Tax Return 'is not' near the federal poverty guidelines, use the online Request for Referral Form below or call TOLL-FREE 888-775-8995 to begin the regular referral intake process. Talk to one of our friendly trained staff who will help you through the intake process step-by-step. A referral administrative fee of $20 is charged for members of CLA. Non-members pay $35 (but you can join CLA at the time of the referral and save the extra $15 that non-members pay).

STEP 2: Financial Screen

If your adjusted gross income on your IRS 1040 Income Tax Return 'is' near the federal poverty guidelines you 'may' qualify for one of our pro bono or modest means programs. If you would like to apply for assistance under one of those programs, please start the lawyer referral process by completing the FINANCIAL SCREENING APPLICATION FORM HERE.

STEP 3: Lawyer Search

Once the intake process — and financial screening (if appropriate) — is completed, our trained staff will begin searching for a qualified attorney with the knowledge and experience to assist you with your specific legal matter. Each lawyer on our panel has up-to-date malpractice insurance and a clean history of no discipline with the State Bar of California.

STEP 4: Lawyer Match

Typically a lawyer match is made within a maximum of 3 to 5 business days for most 'regular' referrals. However, because of the very high demand for pro bono, modest means, and CIAP referrals, the wait for these matches can take longer, and regrettably, in some instances, no match can be found for some cases. The referral administrative fee is not charged for pro bono, modest means, or CIAP* referrals until a match is made.

* CIAP referral administrative fees are higher than standard administrative fees.

If the tenant presents evidence of an unlawful eviction to the Rent Board, the matter may be scheduled for an investigatory hearing before an Administrative Law Judge. After the hearing, the Administrative Law Judge will prepare a summary of the evidence for the consideration of the Rent Board Commission. The Commission may decide to hold additional hearings, to commence legal action against the landlord, to make a referral to the District Attorney for criminal prosecution, or to take no further action. The filing of a Report of Alleged Wrongful Eviction with the Rent Board does not prevent the landlord from pursuing an eviction through the courts.

Here is a description of the service it offers:
Asian and Pacific Islander Family Resources Network (APIFRN) is a collaboration of 20+ agencies providing family support services to Asian and Pacific Islander (API) families in the City and County of San Francisco. A project of APA Family Support Services (formerly Asian Perinatal Advocates), APIFRN offers comprehensive care and support services for API families with children, ages 0-18 years old.

The mutual goals of the project are: strengthen API families and reduce the likelihood of out-of-home placements, increase the use of neighborhood-based resources, and assist families in accessing services in San Francisco.

The APIFRN emphasizes a proactive approach towards the prevention of problems: partner agencies help the family function more effectively and foster a sense of family self-sufficiency and empowerment. The network partners utilize a “building on strengths family model” to promote growth, empowerment and resiliency. Program services are driven by participants’ needs and are responsive in addressing these needs. Network parents play an important role in the design and development of program services and activities, serve as resources for each other, and advocate for themselves in the broader community. The network is culturally sensitive in terms of staffing skills, language capabilities, and geographical accessibilities.

The service name is MicroGrants.
Here is a description of the service it offers:
Microgrants provide trans and nonbinary people with low-barrier funds and support to correct names and/or gender markers on identifying legal documents, fund gender-affirming permanent hair removal, and supply necessities for our trans siblings behind bars.

Putting money directly into trans people’s hands is central to economic and racial justice and our overall well-being. Redistributing funds draws inspiration from the principles of mutual aid: our support of each other is a political act.

Microgrants that may be available: (Please check website for open grants)

- **Name Change Microgrants**- cover all the required fees pertaining to court-ordered name changes. They cover corrections and updates on passports, driver’s licenses, state IDs, birth certificates, and Tribal IDs.

- **Inside Advocacy: Commissary and Post-Release Microgrants** - provides mutual aid to trans folks who are incarcerated or have been recently released. Trans folks impacted by the carceral state are the most vulnerable and cut off from resources. So far, IA has served nearly 400 people. We continue to use our unique place in the TLGBQ+ and suicide prevention movements to partner with other organizations, fight injustice, and advocate for our community.

- **Gender-Affirming Hair Removal Microgrants** - This microgrant seeks to cover a wide spectrum of permanent hair removal procedures for people who experience transmisogyny: the specific oppression directed towards people perceived as transfeminine. This includes trans women, trans femmes, Two Spirit people, and trans and gender non-conforming people who were assigned/assumed male at birth—but is not limited to these labels!

Learn the art of playwriting through our Stories High workshops, Bindlestiff’s longest running page-to-stage program. 

- Meets Tuesdays: 8 sessions
- Virtual Meetings on Zoom
- 6:30pm - 8:30pm PT

*CLASS DESCRIPTION*
In this workshop, we will aim to:

*Discover why you write*

- In this workshop, you will tap into your voice as an artist. You will discover why it is that you want to write. You will be challenged to reflect inward, drawing on your experiences and imaginative interests, and write the stories you want to see out in the world. 

*Create pieces that experiment in playwriting*

- Through in-class exercises and take-home prompts, you will generate pieces in the genre of playwriting. At first, they may be short and rough. Throughout the process you will select pieces to revise and take through the editing process. What you create will not be perfect. You might not like everything you write. That is okay. What matters is the willingness to explore a craft you are unfamiliar with and the commitment to forming your own body of written work.

*Explore what it means to read and respond as a writer.*

- In addition to being a group that writes, this will also be a group that reads. You will read published works by playwrights. You will read deeply into these pieces, taking your initial reactions and looking at how and why the writer was able to evoke this reaction through elements of craft

You will also read each other’s writing. We will discuss methods on how to respond to works that are in progress. Through this workshop we will form a community of artists that read and engage with each other’s work in order to help guide each other through the revision process.

The service name is Immigration & Deportation Defense Clinic.
Here is a description of the service it offers:
The Immigration and Deportation Defense Clinic represents unaccompanied immigrant children and families who are in removal proceedings in the San Francisco Immigration Court. The majority of clients are seeking asylum and come from the Northern Triangle in Central America and Mexico.  Most of the children the clinic represents are also eligible for Special Immigrant Juvenile status and the clinic represents these children in state court as well.

Under the supervision of the director and supervising attorney, students work closely with clients in preparation for their asylum hearings or interviews at the Asylum Office, including the drafting of declarations and supporting evidence, as well as the preparation of direct testimony and practice for their hearing or interview. Some students also help minors in state probate and family law courts who seek guardianships or custody findings in order to qualify for Special Immigrant Juvenile Status. Through their work, students learn how to be ethical and successful immigration attorneys in a nonprofit setting.

The clinic has over 500 active cases. It also employs two other attorneys, three paralegals, and a social services coordinator. The clinic works with people who have escaped extreme violence and trauma, and clients' bravery and strength inspire clinic employees and students alike. In addition to casework, students have the opportunity to participate in clinic-organized events, such as Know Your Rights presentations in the Central Valley and trips to immigration detention facilities and the border.
The clinic partners with collaboratives in San Francisco, Sonoma, and San Mateo counties, and is funded by the City and County of San Francisco, San Mateo County, the Secure Families Collaborative in Sonoma County, and the California Department of Social Services. The clinic also works closely with the Bar Association of San Francisco and community-based organizations throughout California.

As we evaluate our neighborhoods together, we will also identify other quality of life issues in an effort to support more effective service delivery from our City departments,  thereby improving community placemaking overall.

In order to most safely facilitate these important community opportunities, our team will ensure that everyone involved follows mandated COVID-19 public health guidelines, including limiting the number of participants at each gathering, adhering to social distancing protocols, and wearing masks.

Here is a description of the service it offers:
The Human Rights Commission  advocates against discrimination based on: race, ethnicity, sex, disability, sexual orientation, AIDS/HIV status, families with children, source of income, etc. Provides referrals. Languages: multi-language services available.

In 1989, San Francisco passed the "City and County of Refuge" Ordinance (also known as the Sanctuary City Ordinance). The Sanctuary City Ordinance generally prohibits City employees from using City funds or resources to assist Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in the enforcement of Federal immigration law unless such assistance is required by federal or state law.

In 2013, San Francisco passed the “Due Process for All” Ordinance. This ordinance limits when City law enforcement officers may give ICE advance notice of a person’s release from local jail. It also prohibits cooperation with ICE detainer requests, sometimes referred to as “ICE holds.” 

These ordinances were last amended in July 2016. Under current law, City employees may not use City resources to:

- Assist or cooperate with any ICE investigation, detention, or arrest relating to alleged violations of the civil provisions of federal immigration law.
- Ask about immigration status on any application for City benefits, services, or opportunities, except as required by federal or state statute, regulation, or court decision.
- Limit City services or benefits based on immigration status, unless required by federal or state statute or regulation, public assistance criteria, or court decision.
- Provide information about the release status or personal information of any individual, except in limited circumstances when law enforcement may respond to ICE requests for notification about when an individual will be released from custody.
- Detain an individual on the basis of a civil immigration detainer after that individual becomes eligible for release from custody.

HRC is charged with implementing the Sanctuary City Ordinance by assisting the public in filing, mediating, and investigating complaints of non-compliance with the ordinance.
