Problem Statement: There are a myriad of services available for the unhoused population in SF, from temporary and permanent housing options to food banks and mental health services. However, the barrier to access is high for unhoused individuals and indivudals at risk of homelessness. Additionally, San Francisco's case managers and housing counselors are facing critical challenges: overwhelming caseloads, inadequate staffing, and an inefficient distribution of resources. They all navigate a labyrinth of services to aid those in need, often hindered by outdated databases and manual processes, oftentimes preventing individuals from being able to access the services they need.

Our Solution: A chat bot and text-to-voice app leveraging Language Models that automates the identification and matching of client needs to appropriate public benefits and services. The goal is to reduce the manual workload of unhoused individuals, individuals at risk of homelessness, housing counselors, and others in the government to more efficiently access the resources they need.

Demo setup:
